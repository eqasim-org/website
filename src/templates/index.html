        <p>
            Some general explanation about the purpose of the framework and
            why transport planning on a granular level will become important
            in the future.

        <h2>The model</h2>
        <p>
            The eqasim platform is based on the agent-based transport
            simulation framework MATSim, but with a couple of twists.

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            A number of simulation scenarios are available for
            eqasim....

                <b>Paris</b> is the most detailed and well-calibrated
                of the scenarios. It allows for practice-ready policy
                studies and analyses.

                <b>Zurich</b> is the smallest of the available
                use cases, but the one that has been around longest.
